# Galaxy Explorer

Galaxy Explorer is a modern WebGL-powered single-page experience for exploring stylised galaxy systems in 3D. It is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and react-three-fiber.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser to explore the galaxies.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This compiles the site and serves the built assets locally for verification.
